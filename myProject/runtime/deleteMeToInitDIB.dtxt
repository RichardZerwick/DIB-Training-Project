If this file does not exist in the /runtime/ folder, Dropinbase will perform the following actions to initialize certain basic configurations:
					- Create the /runtime/ folder with its subfolders
					- Create the Dib.php file if it does not exist based on the /configs/DibTmpl.php file
					- Check if there are new dropin folders and create 'module' dropin records in pef_dropin for them
					- Check if the dibDatabaseVersion setting in pef_setting corresponds with the latest build no in /vendor/dropinbase/dropinbase/Migration Scripts.dtxt.
					  If not, attempt to run the outstanding scripts, and update the dibDatabaseVersion setting.
					  NOTE: please check if this file has any other notices like PHP changes that must be made!
